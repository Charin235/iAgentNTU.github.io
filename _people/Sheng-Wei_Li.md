Hello, I am Sheng-Wei Li (李勝維). But you can call me Oscar. I graduated from NYCU (former NCTU) with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 

I like playing darts and recently ranked up to (DARTSLIVE) RATING 9. Along with this, I also like to read novels. My all-time favorite novel is <a href="https://book.qidian.com/info/1003242530/">孺子帝</a>.

My research interests are Deep learning, especially Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision.
